## Primate Facial Recognition

**Abstract:** This project aims to develop a computer vision system capable of recognizing and distinguishing different primates based on facial features. It involves designing a deep learning model trained on a dataset of primate images, potentially gathered from zoos, wildlife documentaries, and field researchers. The goal is not only to distinguish between different species, but also to recognize individuals within a species.

**Keywords:** 
- Computer Vision
- Primatology
- Facial Recognition

**Point Person:** John Doe

**Expected timeline:** 1 semester

**Skill Level:** This project is ideal for a senior with knowledge of Python, Machine Learning, and a basic understanding of Computer Vision.
