#### The event

[Daniel Acuna](/people/daniel_e_acuna/) and [Titipat Achakulvisut](/people/titipat_achakulvisut/) presented
their work before ~80 Python developers from the Chicago Python user group [ChiPy](http://chipy.org). 

Their talk explained how they use Python to improve [scientific conferences](http://scholarfy.net)
and [peer review](http://pr.scienceofscience.org). They shared their tools, workflows, and open
source projects, which you can find in [Daniel's Github repo](http://github.com/daniel-acuna) and
[Titipat's Github repo](http://github.com/titipata).

#### About ChiPy

The [ChiPy](http://chipy.org) community is extremely friendly and open to new ideas. They welcome everybody, even people
who have no programming experience! Recently, they have created Special Interest Groups (SIG) for Science and Finance
developers ([more info about SIG](http://www.chipy.org/pages/SIGs/)).
