To achieve the goal in different scale of Measurement:

| Goal        | Interval/ratio| Ordinal  |Nominal |
|:------------- |:-------------|------| |
| **Describe one group**     | Mean, standard deviation | Median; interquartile range | proportion |
| **Compare one group to <br>a hypothetical value**    | One-sample t-test; Z-test:<br> (for true variance known; <br>or very big sample size)     |   Wilcoxon signed rank test | Chi-square test |
| **Compare two paired <br>groups** | Paired t-test       | Wilcoxon signed rank test | McNemarâ€™s test|
| **Compare two unpaired <br>groups**| Unpaired/ two-sample t-test | Mann-Whitney U test| Chi-square test|
| **Compare three or more p<br>aired groups**| ANOVA repeated measures | Friedman test |  Cochraine Q|
| **Compare three or more <br>unpaired groups**| ANOVA | Kruskal-Wallis| Chi-square test|
| **Quantify association <br>between 2 variables**| Pearson correlation| Spearman correlation| Contigency coefficients|
| **Predict value from <br>another measured <br>variable**| Simple linear regression| | |
