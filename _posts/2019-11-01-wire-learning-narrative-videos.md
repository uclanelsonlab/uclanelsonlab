<p>In this collection of learning narrative videos, WI+RE Creative Team members share meaningful, memorable, and transformative moments from their own learning experiences.</p>

<p>In creating these short narratives, WI+RE takes a practical approach to learning pedagogy by connecting theoretical ideas with real life experiences. For more on this experiential approach to learning about pedagogy, see <a href="https://uclalibrary.github.io/foundations/modules/key-ideas/key-ideas/" target="_blank">Foundations in Learner-Centered Design: Key Ideas</a>.
