Here, we document how to configure `quadcorn` for remote access.


We mostly followed the instructions [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ssh-essentials-working-with-ssh-servers-clients-and-keys).

### On the server

Setup user accounts on `quadcorn`

```
>> sudo useradd -m --create-home USERNAME
```

Choose password:

```
>> sudo passwd USERNAME
```

See [here](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87114/how-do-i-know-a-specified-users-permissions-on-linux-with-root-access) if you forgot `-m`.

Once you have created the users, setup the usergroup.

```
>> sudo groupadd -r GROUPNAME
```

Add each user to the group.

```
>> sudo usermod -a -G GROUPNAME user1
>> sudo usermod -a -G GROUPNAME user2
```

Start the SSH service.

```
>> /etc/init.d/ssh start
```

Open the SSH Daemon config file.

```
>> atom /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add the following lines to only allow our user group:

```
#Which groups of users to allow
AllowGroups GROUPNAME
```

Edit the port number with a custom PORT_NUMBER:

```
#What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for
#Port 22
Port PORT_NUMBER
```

Check that X11 forwarding is set to yes:

```
X11Forwarding yes
```

We used:

```
GROUPNAME=kordinglab
PORT_NUMBER=5000
```

Once this is done, just restart the ssh server:

```
sudo service ssh restart
```

### On your client

The IP address of our server will be given to you.

To login to the server, type:

```
>> ssh -X -p PORT_NUMBER USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS
```

But we can do better than remembering all these details. We need to let the ssh program know the host IP address, the user login, and the port to listen to. To do so, create the `~/.ssh/config` file:

```
>> atom ~/.ssh/config`
```

Type in the following:

```
Host quadcorn
  HostName IP_ADDRESS
  ForwardX11 yes
  Compression yes
  Ciphers blowfish-cbc
  Port PORT_NUMBER
  User USERNAME
```

Now we can simply do this instead:

```
>> ssh quadcorn
```

This replaces the much more cumbersome option where you need to remember everything.

### Customize your settings to use global software installs

Once you login to `quadcorn`, 
to make sure that you can use most of the installed software, 
you need to edit your `~/.profile` file.

```
>> atom ~/.profile
```

Now add the following lines:

```
# set PATH to include anaconda global directory
PATH="/opt/anaconda/anaconda2/bin:$PATH"

# set PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH for cuda
export PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64"

# to get the bash shell, otherwise you get `/bin/sh` by default
/bin/bash
```

To test that the path to python is set correctly, type:

```
>> which python
```

You should see:

```
/opt/anaconda/anaconda2/bin/python
```

To test whether cuda is installed correctly, type:

```
>> nvcc -V
```

You should see something like:

```

```
