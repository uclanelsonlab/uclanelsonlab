Davy completed his BA and BS degrees in chemistry, genetics and psychology from the University of California, Berkeley and his SM degree from Harvard University in computational biology. He is now a doctoral candidate in the joint Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology, Medical Engineering and Medical Physics program. 

Davy is interested in developing and applying technologies to simulate and reverse engineer the nervous system of c.elegans. Through his interdisciplinary research, he aims to better understand the roadmap and make stride towards the distant goal of mind-uploading and whole brain emulation. He is co-advised by Konrad Kording and Ed Boyden (MIT) [https://synthneuro.org/people/].
