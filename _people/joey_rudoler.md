## About Me
I'm a statistics PhD student at Wharton, with a background in physics and computational neuroscience. I hang out with KLab a lot even though I don't have any official ties. 

I got my MSE in data science at as well, and did my master's thesis research with Dr. Kording. I previously worked full-time as a programmer for Dr. Michael Kahana and Penn's Computational Memory Lab.

## My interests
Broadly interested in data, machine learning, and brains. I've done a lot of work with EEG and human memory in the past. Right now I'm excited about:
* Methods for rigorous uncertainty quantification, especially in deep learning
* Decoding brain activity using machine learning + applying to closed-loop algorithms
* Transfer learning / domain adaptation
* Open science initiatives, esp. tools for data standardization and sharing.
