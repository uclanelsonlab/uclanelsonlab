### Bio

Felipe Parodi, originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina, received his B.S. in Neuroscience and Economics from the University of Miami. During his undergraduate studies, he contributed to neurolinguistic pain modulation research in the [Social and Cultural Neuroscience Lab](http://www.losinlab.org/). Following graduation, Felipe worked as a Psychometrician at First Choice Neurology, refining screening instruments to predict cognitive dysfunction in diverse geriatric populations. When he isn't immersed in research, Felipe enjoys playing soccer, indulging in people-watching, and on a personal mission to discover and craft the perfect burger.

### Research Interests

Currently a PhD candidate in Neuroscience, Felipe is mentored by Konrad Kording and Michael Platt. His research focus lies at the intersection of deep learning, wireless neurophysiology, and computer vision, aiming to unravel the neural representation of social primate gestures and touch.
