bio: >- 
    jeannie-chen (陳宇晶) earned her MLIS from UCLA and her BA in English from California State University at Northridge (CSUN). Her areas of interest include instructional design & pedagogy, academic librarianship, archival studies, literature, music & performing arts, and Asian American Studies. Through her WI+RE experience, she learned elements of prototyping, scripting, storyboarding, and basic web development skills that have remained useful to her current work today. She has plans to pursue a Master of Education (M.Ed.) in the Learning Design and Technology Program at the University of Southern California, with expected completion in 2022.  My WI+RE Projects include: Reading Strategies (Annotation), WI+RE Learning Narratives, Contacting Instructors (contributed to the handout's content and design with Kian Ravaei), a mini-project to supplement simplified Chinese subtitles to existing English subtitles in Mapping Your Research Ideas (video).
