           <p class="mt-0 mb-0">"Stigma and social inequality deprive disadvantaged social groups of a sense of social well-being. Stress researchers have focused on prejudice-related events and conditions but have not described more intangible stressors experienced by sexual minorities. We use narrative methods to examine how sexual minorities experience stigma and social inequality as we focus on the more intangible stressors that are both pervasive and difficult to measure. Three themes emerged in the narratives of our ethnically diverse sample of 57 adult sexual minority women and men: (a) stigma deprived them of access to critical possibilities and opportunities; (b) stigma deprives them of safety and acceptance; and (c) despite this, the experience of stigma is also related to the adoption of a positive and collective orientation towards their stigmatized identities. Recognizing these stressors and related resilience can direct policy makers toward interventions that go even beyond eliminating prejudice by including goals to strengthen minority communities."<br><br> (<a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0842x56p" target="_blank">'"We'd Be Free": Narratives of Life Without Homophobia, Racism, or Sexism' by Ilan H.

She is a former public school teacher with seven years of experience in a diverse classroom (approx. 40% African American, 40% Hispanic American, and 20% Caucasian American). Her research is conducted at a local community tutoring program in Los Angeles that serves 120 high school students each week.

Working with community students who are fluent in Spanish and have some ability to communicate in English is within her skill range, but when interacting with students new to English, she relies on translators to help ensure clear communication. Sometimes these translators are professionals employed by the school district or community center and sometimes they are other students.
