<i class="text-muted">This tutorial is excerpted from the <a href="{{ '/workshops/finding-a-mentor-or-project/' | relative_url }}">Finding a Research Mentor or Project</a> workshop. Check out the <a href="{{ '/workshops/#entering-research-workshops' | relative_url }}">Entering Research Workshops</a> for more tips on getting started with research!</i>

## Identify Your Research Interests

Before you look for a research opportunity, it’s important to **think about what research areas you find interesting**. If you want tips for identifying your research interests, try our <a href="{{ '/questions/' | relative_url }}">Start with your Questions</a> tutorial!

It’s also a good idea to think about whether you want to pursue a faculty- or student-led project. 

- A **faculty-led project** gives you the chance to help a faculty member on a research project that they lead. 
- A **student-led project** gives you the chance to pursue a project of your own design under the guidance of a faculty mentor. 

Check out the <a href="{{ '/workshops/research-logistics/' | relative_url }}">Research Logistics at UCLA</a> workshop for more information on faculty- and student-led research!

## 1. Browse the Departmental Website

Browsing departmental websites and contacting faculty members with relevant interests can open the door to research opportunities!

## 2. Ask About Research Opportunities

You might not know it, but there are lots of people around you who do research! Talking to them is a great way to find research opportunities.

## 3. UCLA Undergraduate Research Portal

The <a href="https://be.my.ucla.edu/urportal.aspx" target="_blank">UCLA Undergraduate Research Portal</a> is a free online resource for UCLA students to find research opportunities, including paid and off-campus opportunities. Check out this video for more information!

<iframe class="mb-5" src="https://uclabruinlearn.h5p.com/content/1291709899660042938/embed" width="1074" height="666" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/assets/js/resizer.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

## What's next?

Now that you know how to find research opportunities, **make a list of at least 5 potential mentors and/or research projects you would like to pursue**. Here are some things to consider!

- How interested am I in the research topic?
- How long is the project?
- How many hours per week will I work?
- Is the opportunity paid or unpaid? Will I receive course credit?
