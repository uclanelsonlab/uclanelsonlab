Atoms make up everything around us, and orbitals and electron configurations help us understand how they operate! _Electron Configurations_ is an interactive tutorial that walks learners through understanding what an orbital represents, and how we can use electron configurations to visualize the placement of electrons around an atom. These concepts are important to help learners visualize the relationship between electrons and the elements they are apart of!
